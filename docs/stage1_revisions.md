In our revision, we fixed the following sections:

**Realness**: We added extra information on where we will obtain the real data sets. The data is going to be from Yahoo Finance, and we’ll incorporate fundamental financial data from the U.S. SEC EDGAR “Company Facts” API, which provides corporate filings and metrics such as revenue, net income, and EPS in JSON/CSV format. We also added the data size.

**Functionality**: We updated our functionality component, where we explained the different features that our website would have. For each one, we explained how the user can interact with it (create, delete, update, or search for) depending on the feature. 

**UI Mockup**: We included a UI mockup of what it will look like if a user opens their homepage. 

**Project Work Distribution**:  We added a work distribution section, specifically indicating which member will be responsible for each task.

**Updates in TeamInfo.md:** We updated the project title in GitHub.
