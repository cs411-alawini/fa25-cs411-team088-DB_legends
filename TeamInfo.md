## Project Summary

This web-based application will allow users to practice their trading skills on both historical/real and artificial stock markets. In addition, users can trade together in groups, compete against each other (e.g., users vs. users, groups vs. groups), and participate in tournaments between users and groups (with potential prizes for high-placing participants).
